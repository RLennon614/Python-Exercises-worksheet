🐍 Python Fundamentals & Problem-Solving Exercises

🎯 Overview

This repository contains my completed solutions for Python programming exercises from my Data Technician training course. The exercises are designed to build a solid foundation in core Python concepts, focusing on algorithmic thinking, data manipulation, and control flow.

The primary goal is to demonstrate proficiency in writing clean, efficient, and well-commented Python code.

📂 Repository Structure

The solutions are organized by training day, with each folder containing a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) that includes the problem statement, the Python code solution, and the resulting output.

Day 2 Solutions

Control Flow & Conditionals

⭐ Example Highlights

Day 1: Digit Extraction & Manipulation

The core challenge was to manipulate the digits of a number without converting the number to a string. This demonstrates understanding of Python's fundamental operators:

Problem: Find the sum of the digits of a three-digit number.

Concepts: Using the modulus operator (%) to isolate the last digit, and floor division (//) to drop the last digit.

Result: A program that can accurately calculate complex numerical properties using pure arithmetic logic.

Day 2: Conditional Logic & Flow Control

This section verifies the ability to build programs that make decisions based on different inputs:

Problem: Create a program that determines the user's age category (Child, Teenager, Adult) based on input.

Concepts: Nested if/elif/else statements to define clear execution paths.

Result: Robust programs that handle multiple scenarios and ensure only one outcome is achieved per input.

⚙️ How to View the Solutions

To explore the code and see the live output:

Clone the repository.

Install Jupyter: If you don't have it, install Jupyter Notebook or use an environment like VS Code or Google Colab.

Open: Navigate to the specific notebook (e.g., Python_Day_1_Exercises_Solutions.ipynb) and open it. The markdown cells explain the problem, and the code cells provide the solution.

I am continuously adding to this repository as I progress through new Python topics like loops, functions, and data structures.
